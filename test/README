This repository provides the basic source code necessary to get started on the
chirc project. It also includes several automated tests for students to verify
the correctness of their implementation.

Please see http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chirc/ for a specification of the chirc
project, including specific assignments, instructions on how to build the 
project, and on how to run the tests.
